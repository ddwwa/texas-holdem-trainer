# PWA Icons

The placeholder icon files need to be replaced with actual PNG images.

## Quick Icon Generation

You can generate icons using:

1. **Online Tool**: https://realfavicongenerator.net/
   - Upload a square image (at least 512x512)
   - Download the generated icons
   - Replace icon-192.png and icon-512.png

2. **Design Tool** (Figma, Canva, etc.):
   - Create a 512x512 canvas
   - Add poker-themed design (cards, chips, etc.)
   - Export as PNG at 192x192 and 512x512

3. **Simple Placeholder**:
   - Use any poker card image
   - Resize to 192x192 and 512x512
   - Save as PNG

## Recommended Design
- Background: Dark blue (#1e3a8a)
- Icon: Playing cards (♠ ♥ ♦ ♣) or poker chips
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes
